This project mimicks the potential additional feature of prioritizing the Youtube (or any other) Watch later list.

User can choose a level of priority (how interested they are in watching the video) when adding that video to the watch later list.
Later, along with the original sorting options i.e. latest added, oldest added, oldest created, latest created - new options to sort by highest or lowest priority are also available.

* Backend code only
* Created as a semester project experimenting with Java language
